// This Macro should swap to a defensive weapon when entering bear form, and a regular weapon when exiting bear form
//Enter/Exit Bear Macro (hotkeyed to 'Z' in all forms)

//Known Issue: Cannot swap weapons and form within a GCD while in-combat right now. Recommend just switching to bear form with 'Z' and switching weapons seperately.
