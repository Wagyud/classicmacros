// This Macro should swap to a defensive weapon when entering bear form, and a regular weapon when exiting bear form
// It is currently done in two macros bound to the 'Z' key, one for every hotbar but bear and one for bear.
// Working on a version that can do it all in one macro (In bear, equip B/C and cancel form, out of bear, equip A and enter bear form)


//Enter Bear Macro (hotkeyed to 'Z' in all forms BUT bear)
